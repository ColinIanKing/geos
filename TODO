code purity:
- throughoutly test it with various configurations
- cleanup code using !zone's
- don't install REU cache code (drv1541.tas) if there's no REU

code extensions:
- upgrade DlgBox to use more than 16 files
- allow to use +60K and RamCart simultaneousy (hell!)
- allow to swap Kernal modules to/from expansion
- disk cache (at least dir cache) (hell!)
- try to rewrite 1571/81 to use Burst commands instead of turbodos
